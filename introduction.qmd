As per [@lantsoght2018], one should start very early! Here is an interesting equation:

$$
x^2
$$ {#eq-1}

And a nice table, as seen on @eq-1:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-planets
#| tbl-cap: Planets
#| echo: false
gt::gt(head(ggplot2::mpg))
```

![Some nice flowers](images/IMG_1158.jpg){#fig-flowers fig-align="center" width="200"}

@tbl-planets has nothing to do with [^introduction-1] @fig-flowers.

[^introduction-1]: At least I assume so.
